📝 NEP Timetable – SIH Hackathon Project

The NEP Timetable is an innovative solution developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) to align academic timetables with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.
Our project aims to simplify and automate flexible, multidisciplinary scheduling for colleges and universities.

🚀 Key Features

📚 Multidisciplinary Course Selection – allows students to choose electives across different departments.

🔄 Dynamic Timetable Generation – automatically adjusts schedules based on chosen courses and faculty availability.

🔗 Cross-Institution Flexibility – supports seamless timetable integration when students shift between institutions mid-semester.

📊 Conflict-Free Scheduling – ensures no overlapping classes or resource conflicts.

👩‍🏫 Faculty & Room Management – optimizes classroom and teacher allocation.

🌐 User-Friendly Dashboard – clean, intuitive interface for both students and administrators.

💡 Motivation

With NEP 2020 emphasizing academic flexibility and holistic learning, traditional rigid timetables fail to meet these needs. This project reimagines how timetables can adapt to a student-centric approach.
